# week-template

> This is a **TEMPLATE** repository for a weekly content including the lab and coding exercises.

This week's lab is meant to give you a very basic introduction to the Python coding environment. In particular, we will focus on the following:

- JupyterLab and Markdown
- Variables and Data Types
- Operators and Logic
- Packages, Modules, and Objects

## setup

*(As of April 2025)*

1. Fork this repository.
2. [Create a Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository#creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository) for your repository. Use this to view the lab notebook and work on your weekly coding exercise.
3. Submit a URL to your (forked) repository on Canvas ([using Gradescope](https://guides.gradescope.com/hc/en-us/articles/21865616724749-Submitting-a-Code-assignment)).

## exercises

**For the exercises, only update the *apputil.py* file or the *app.py* file.** Updating any other files may affect your autograder feedback.

## for instructors

### setup and testing on autograder

1. First, make sure you adjust the [autograder settings](https://gradescope-autograders.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autograder_settings.png) accordingly.
2. **Copy** this repository as a template for each coding exercise.
3. Uncomment the `autograder` line in the *.gitignore* file.
4. Update the tests and the app or apputil file accordingly. Create a new github repository for the exercise, and update the Dockerfiles as needed.

### other notes

- If you're running on a recent MacBook, you'll need to use [multi-platform building](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/#simple-multi-platform-build-using-emulation). For this, reference the command commented at the top of the *Dockerfile*.
- This repository (aside from the *autograder* directory) represents an example of a students's submission.
- The contents of the *autograder/tests* folder and the *results.json* file are only examples, and should be tailored to the exercise at hand.
  - Everything else in the *autograder* directory is meant to be generic for all exercises.
- See the [gradescope Python example](https://github.com/gradescope/autograder_samples/tree/master/python) for more on how this repo is organized.
- Use this as a *template* for actual exercises. Before sharing the template with students, delete the *autograder* directory, and uncomment the `autograder` line in the *.gitignore* file in actual exercises. This will hide the solutions for students.
- See [here](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-best-practices-understanding-the-differences-between-add-and-copy-instructions-in-dockerfiles/) for the difference between `ADD` and `COPY` in Docker, explaining why the latter was used here.
- Note that you cannot `COPY` from a parent directory, so we need to add the environment update to the *run_autograder* file.
